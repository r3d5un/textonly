# textonly

Textonly is a simple blog app meant to serve as a reference web application written in Go, as well as my personal blog, which you can find [here](https://islandwind.me/).

The goal is to have a codebase where I can experiment with Go, create applications and explore new technologies. As such, some choices surrounding technology choices may be strange, over-engineered or simply bad. If you intend to use this project as a reference, be sure that the design makes sense for you.
